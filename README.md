# <Horiseon Refactor>

## Description

The Horiseon website needed semantic HTML elements to improve it's accessiblity. It also needed to be cleaned up a little bit by consolidating css selectors and properties.

This process helped me to better understand the hierachy of class selectors.

Some additional visual edits have been made, such as underlining links on hover, and a javascript function to show the correct year for the Copyright footer. There is a seperate branch called "refactor-only" that removes these embelishments if not desired.

## Installation

To view the website visit [fawltya.github.io/horiseon-refactor](https://fawltya.github.io/horiseon-refactor)
